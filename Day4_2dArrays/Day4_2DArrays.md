ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ 2D Arrays



âœ… Topics Covered:

* Matrix traversal (row-wise, column-wise, diagonal)



* Spiral order



* Rotate matrix (in-place)
* 

âœ… Problems Solved:

1.Spiral Matrix - Boundaries approach (top, bottom, left, right)

2.Rotate Image (90Â° Clockwise) â€“ Transpose + Reverse each row (in-place)

3.Diagonal Traverse â€“ Zig-zag traversal with direction change
