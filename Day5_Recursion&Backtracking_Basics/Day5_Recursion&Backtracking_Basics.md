📅 Day 5 – Recursion + Backtracking Basics

✅ Topics Covered:

⦁	Recursive call stack & base case logic

⦁	Backtracking tree exploration

⦁	Subset building using include/exclude pattern

✅ Problems Solved:
1.Fibonacci Number - plain recursion, optimized to O(n) with memoization
2.Factorial of N – Recursive multiplication
3.Subsets – Backtracking template → pick or not pick strategy
